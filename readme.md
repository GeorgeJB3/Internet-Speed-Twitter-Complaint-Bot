# Internet-speed-twitter-complaint-bot

This was part of my '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023' course.
I have used selenium to retrieve my internet download and upload speeds from speedtest.net. 
If they are lower than what I pay for in my contract the bot logs into twitter and tweets the speeds.
This can be programmed to tweet the provider directly.
I have used OOP to make it easier to read.
